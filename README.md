# About
This repository contains a self guided project I completed during the [Full Stack developer](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) career path course. 

To complete the project I was required to configure an application that allows a user to authorize using Github as an OAuth provider. To do so I used `express`, and `express-session`, as well as `passport` using the `passport-github2` strategy.
